    <h2><b>Ingredients:</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (5 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sazonador total (from Goya)</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><b>Steps or Cooking Instructions:</b></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.</li>
        <li>Step 2. Drizzle olive oil over chicken breasts coating all sides. Combine sazonador total, garlic, salt, and pepper in a small bowl and sprinkle on all sides of the chicken breasts. Place chicken breasts onto the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Step 3. Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until chicken breast is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Do not overbake. Allow to rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
